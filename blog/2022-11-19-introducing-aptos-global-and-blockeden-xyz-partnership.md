We are excited to announce our partnership with Aptos Global, the first Aptos Eco APEC Community. This partnership integrates a platform for research, Move language education, and eco-projects development into one neat little package.

Not only will this teach new skills and strengthen developer communities, but it will also push the limits of new technologies and foster a world-class ecosystem of Aptos developers and entrepreneurs. And what's more - BlockEden.xyz has been chosen as the infrastructure provider of choice for all affiliated projects!

We believe that a simpler and overall better developer experience is key to broad web3 adoption. That's why we've dedicated ourselves to providing a suite of APIs that power DApps for Aptos and Sui blockchains of all sizes. So whether you're just getting started or you're looking to scale up, BlockEden.xyz has you covered.
